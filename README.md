# Get started with a simple blog in ReactJs

The idea is to add complexity to the blog, as well as styles.
I am currently using tailwind css, but am considering doing my own styling with SASS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
